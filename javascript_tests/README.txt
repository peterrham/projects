./README.txt

The above named file is this file. This file explains the contents of
this directory for future use, after I forget what these files were
intended for. I have chosen to use the file extension ".txt" for "text
file" instead of the more unix-y "README" with no file extension. I
have chosen this file extension so that viewing the file on windows or
macos will be more obvious. Hopefully, those exploring this directory
will know to go to this file first.

Some brief comments on the files in this directory.

These files are mostly experimental html and javascript files which
help me learn html or javascript or solve problems by debugging with
small examples which I can hopefully come back to in the future to
refresh my memory or debug a new problem.

./hello_world.html 

The above file is not even really html. There's no html markup in the
file, but it demonstrates that a web browser can digest and display
simple text. This file is useful for debugging whether a web server or
browser is workint *at all*! Or for showing a beginning html author
(like myself), that you can get started right away without being too
intimidated by correct html syntax with "funny characters".


./test.txt

I actually have no idea what this file is for. This file simply
contains some kind of unique identifier:

6a193867-aefe-11e2-a661-ff378497d577

I should probably delete this file, but I'm putting it under version
control, just in case ....

./hello_world.rhtml

A trivial ruby embedded ruby (erb) file to show how to write a quick
Ruby webserver for a small project. I think that this works outside of
Ruby on Rails, but do not remember for sure.

It is a bit confusing that this file has the same name, but different
extension than ./hello_word.html. I will fix that when I learn git a
bit better and know how to rename files safely.
