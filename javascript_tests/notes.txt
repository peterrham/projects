-- Regarding my tcpdump tests for browsers

Notice that for chrome and multiple images
- there's a gap between downloading the html body and the images
- the images are still downloaded in series
- the extent to which the downloads are in series seems to vary a bit due to what? threading race condition

firefox 
- has the same issue with the gap, but of a different length
- it's hard to see the in series versus in parallel of firefox, since the downloads ae so quick
- this may be changed due to the "max threads in parallel configuration" in terms of "pipelinining"

- let's see if I cann connect internet explorer

on windows remote talking to s3 via beanstalk:
 - chrome: the initial file download is 200 to 300 ms, still the next request is 60 ms after, still a break

- firefox: the gap still exists on firefox, show I try multiple download if they are in series?

- internet explorer loads the right in series which is great

- here's the metrics before optimizing with optimap (which took a long time, maybe around 5 minutes

Minutes (total): 463.0
Distance (miles) (total): 271.9
Speed (miles per hour): 35.2

-- after optimizing with optimap (almost 1/4 of the time)

Minutes (total): 160.7
Distance (miles) (total): 62.9
Speed (miles per hour): 23.5
