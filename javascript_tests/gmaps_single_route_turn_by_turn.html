    <title>Turn By Turn Directions</title>

  <!-- 

       This simple web application takes a list of addresses, plots them
       on a map, uses google maps to calculate turn by turn driving
       directions between the addresses, and plots them on a map,
       including the turn by turn directions highlight along the road
       network, instead of straight, Euclidean lines.

       The google geolocation of users current address, determined by
       IP address geolocation from google maps, only works (so far) if
       the web page is retrieved from a web server and not from the
       file server.

       There is a limit on the number and the size of the turn by turn
       directions requests made to google maps over a period of time for
       a free account. This program tries to gracefully utilize the all
       the capacity allowed and report when it has.

       The directions service query limit seems to be 10 within a
       certain amount of time. We could throttle it based on time
       perhaps.

       One objective of this web app is to generate driving time and
       driving distance metrics for a route in order to compare routes
       and route sequences.

       XXX Obsolete
       This code uses "promises" in order to execute asynchronously in a
       clean and systematic way. It's confusing however!

       XXX This code now uses a throttling mechanism to now overload
       google maps usage limits.

       Note: the document ready handler and later the submit form
       button are attached in the main javascript file loaded by
       requireJS.

       XXX todo (things to fix/improve)
       - get rid of global variables, expecially in the "calc" (sp.) .js file
       - error message when current location is not available is not good, it's wrong
       - screen starts out in chicago first, which is not the greatest
       - not sure what behavior should be when geolocation is not available
       - jslint http://www.jslint.com/lint.html
       - need to undelete javascript_utilities.js since it is still used in the simple examples and it has the benefit that

       - it does not depend upon the "require" library as does

       - local_javascript_utilities.js, need to clean this up, since
       file names are too - similar and the contents are the same - I
       think that using require library is too heavy weight for simple
       javascript examples ...  - move this list to a TODO file -
       configure selenium to automatically test my stuff, or at least
       see it executed without typing it myself to verify my changes
