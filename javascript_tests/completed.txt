- tasks that have been completed:

- gmaps_single ....
  - clear the previous route when generating a new one
    11:25 am, 11:42 am, done, just required commenting something back in, but it will probably interfere with future batching work, ok for now
    - get rid of the testing square image
      done
  - done - zoom to the entire route
     working on this one: 8:40pm
   - done, the zooming does not seem perfect, but pretty good and much better, than before

  - get rid of ugly and large index numbers on route path
    - i made soe improvements here, but it still does not loo great
