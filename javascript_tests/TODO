- gmaps_single ....
  - clear the previous route when generating a new one
    11:25 am, 11:42 am, done, just required commenting something back in, but it will probably interfere with future batching work, ok for now
    - get rid of the testing square image
      done
  - zoom to the entire route
     working on this one: 8:40pm
